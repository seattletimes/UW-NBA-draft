    "chatter": "Pondexter led the Huskies to the Sweet 16 in his senior season and finished as a first team All-Pac-12 selection. He was drafted by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round, with the 26th overall pick, but was traded to New Orleans two weeks later. He played only one season with Hornets before he was traded to Memphis. Pondexter hasn't played since the 2015 postseason, when he was with the Pelicans, because he's currently recuperating from a knee injury. He's under contract with the Pelicans for one more season.",

    "chatter": "Holiday was a three-year starter for UW who finished his career as a co-captain along with teammate Isaiah Thomas. He went undrafted in 2011, then played in Belgium for a season before bouncing around the D League. His big break came when he signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2014 and won an NBA championship when the Warriors defeated Cleveland in 2015. Last summer, the Warriors traded Holiday to the New York Knicks.",

Ross never played in the NCAA Tournament, but helped the Huskies reach the semifinals of the NIT his sophomore season. He was drafted with the No. 8 overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in 2012, and instantly wowed with his dunking ability, most notably showcasing his talents by winning the 2013 NBA Dunk Contest. Ross was traded in February to the Orlando Magic.",

    "image": "isaiah.jpg",
    "chatter": "Isaiah Thomas' career at UW can best be summed up in two words: 'Cold blooded.' That was the phrase used to describe IT's game-winning jumper, completing a 28-point effort to take down Arizona in the 2011 Pac-12 Championship game. With Thomas leading the way, the Huskies made three consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament, reaching the Sweet 16 in 2010 and losing in the second round the other two seasons. UW has yet to get back to the Big Dance following Thomas' exit after 2011.<p>Thomas was drafted with the final pick of the 2012 NBA draft (pick No. 60) by the Sacramento Kings -- a spot that looks pretty silly in hindsight. 5 years later, Thomas is coming off far-and-away his finest NBA season, racking up 28.9 points per game with the Celtics and earning second team All NBA honors, along with his second straight NBA All-Star game.

Wilcox's scoring ability was his best asset for the Huskies, as the shooting guard averaged more than 18 points per game in his final season, and amassed 1,880 points over his college career, which ranks second all-time in UW history.<p>Wilcox was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014 with the 28th overall pick, where he was a bench player. He was traded in July, 2016 to the Orlando Magic, but is currently playing for the Magic's D-League affiliate Lakeland Magic. ",

Despite his success, the Huskies were a massive failure in Fultz's lone season -- mustering only nine wins and ending with longtime coach Lorenzo Romar's departure from the program.<p>Fultz instantly becomes UW's highest-profile NBA prospect, and is expected to go No. 1 overall in Thursday's draft to the Philadelphia 76ers. Many expect the youngster to make an immediate impact on the NBA, and potentially grow into a superstar at the next level.",
